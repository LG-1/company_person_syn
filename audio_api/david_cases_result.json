                "transcript": "analysis, and I am being joined once more by Dan Tobin, our senior FX strategist. Uh, well, first of all, happy New Year to all of you, Including to you, then, of course. And it's gonna be another eventful year, I'm sure. So to begin with, let's focus on what's the next urgent event and a milestone. We're looking at that Georgia run off the well near final remnants off the U. S. Election. You've covered it extensively and also well, what do you think we'll come out tonight or in the next few days? And how do you think markets will react it? Right? So it's It's a big market focus, of course, because it's basically for control of the Senate. And with Democrats having control of the White House on the house, you know, if they were to manage to win both of these seats, then effectively they would have control of the Senate. It'd be 50 50 but Vice president or incoming Vice President Harris would be the tie breaking vote. Um, and that would create a very different policy mix potentially from what we see. If we get status quo, which is the Republicans managed to hold onto the majority. They only need to win one of the two seats in order to maintain that majority. So you know it's gonna be close. Um, certainly. You know, whether you look at all the forecast, the polls, betting markets, expert opinions, it all looks like it's gonna be very close way still see a little bit of an advantage for Republicans here, but we'll all be watching very carefully. Hopefully, we have results tonight, but maybe potentially This extends until Wednesday or Thursday. Are biased again, being that it might be a little bit sooner than people are anticipating, but nonetheless, it's gonna be close. And we're gonna have to watch, um, close and carefully. So implications for markets, you know, the if we maintain status quo, it really shouldn't have that much of an impact. Eso We actually think there's an asymmetry here where Republicans managed to maintain control. Um, you know, maybe we see a little bit of a dollar squeeze on Lee because we've seen a little bit of a ramping up in expectations that this will be close. Where it's just a few weeks ago, it was kind of on expectation that Republicans would win. So maybe you get a little bit of a dollar squeeze. Um, for us, that would be an opportunity to then fade that because structurally we still like, Ah, weaker dollar. Andi, Even if we have this split Congress, there's nothing that would suggest that we're not going to continue to see some further fiscal measures. I'm still really rates remaining very depressed. So a lot of stimulus from the monetary side, a lot of these factors that will weigh on the dollar, That's not gonna change based on Republicans holding on to the Senate. The thing is, if the Democrats gain control were probably likely to see ah, much larger outsized response because then the policy makes is gonna be very different in terms of a lot more deficit. Spending breakevens and inflation expectations probably rise a lot more than nominal yields just given Fed policy. So again, we see real rates even lower, weighing on the dollar even further. So if Democrats do, when we do expect, we'll actually get ah, pretty sizable dollar sell off. And so if you think about it, if we're going into the event tonight, you either have a potential for a little bit of a dollar squeeze that you want to sell into, or a big dollar sell off on a Democrat win. In which case, given that asymmetry, it's just attractive to be short dollars anyway and then just add to it. If we do get that Republican, when we think any type of weakness, they're starting the strength, there will be relatively short lived, you know, for other asset classes, um, it becomes a little bit more complicated. Certainly, concerns around taxes could see a little bit of weakness into equity markets. But we think could be relatively short lived to be a dip to buy because the offsetting dynamic of fiscal greater, um, deficit spending pushing growth should be relatively mawr supportive for risk markets than any negatives. It might come from taxes, which could ultimately be pushed on, um, or delayed basis and be smaller than initially expected. So net net. That's kind of how we're looking at it again. That asymmetry that actually favors what are structural view is, which is to continue to be short dollars and thinking about markets overall. Obviously, the end of the end of last year saw yet another leg in a lot of the kind of consensus trades, pre existing patterns as well. So risk assets higher dollar lower, more or less in line with broader sentiment and our outlook for this year as well. So compared to a month ago, has anything changed? And how much further do you think there is to run on this process? The trends? Yeah, there could."
