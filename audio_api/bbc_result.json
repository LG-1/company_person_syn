Well, I got your message about flattening the curve, and then I saw that this table had a bit of a bump in it, so I wanted to make sure you were happy. No, Roy, when I talked about flattening the curve, it relates to lowering and soothing out the peak on a graph or chart. Oh, because you were talking about the rate of infection in the UK it's really important to flatten the curve of the infection to avoid our health care services being overwhelmed with too many patients at one time. That's right. Now let's listen to these examples. The government have introduced social distancing measures to try and flatten the curve. We need to flatten the curve to prevent too many admissions into hospital. Flattening the curve is vital to help save lives. This is the English. We speak from BBC learning English on. We're talking about the expression flatten the curve which has been used a lot during the krona virus crisis. It means to reduce the peak off a graph or chart. Yes. People have been in lock down and social distancing to flatten the curve. It seems that the rate of infection in the UK has decreased of late. Yes, it seems that way.
